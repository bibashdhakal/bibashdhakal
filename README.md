# Hi, I'm Bibash Dhakal 👋

I’m a passionate builder who loves turning ideas into clean, reliable software and learning something new every day. I care about readable code, thoughtful UX, and shipping things that make a difference.

- 🔭 Currently working on: projects that sharpen fundamentals and showcase clean architecture
- 🌱 Learning: deeper OOP principles, testing strategies, and modern web tooling
- 🤝 Open to: collaborating on beginner-friendly OSS and small impactful apps
- ⚡ Fun fact: I document what I learn so future-me says “thanks!”
